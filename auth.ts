/* Explanation:

The code imports necessary modules and types from the next-auth and next-auth/providers/google packages.

The NextAuthOptions type is imported from next-auth, which represents the configuration options for NextAuth.

The GoogleProvider module is imported from next-auth/providers/google, which is a built-in provider for Google authentication in NextAuth.

The authOptions object is defined as a constant of type NextAuthOptions, which will be used to configure NextAuth.

Inside the authOptions object:

The providers array contains the authentication providers to be used with NextAuth.
In this case, only one provider is included: the GoogleProvider.
The GoogleProvider is configured with the clientId and clientSecret obtained from environment variables (process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET respectively). These environment variables should be set in your environment configuration (e.g., .env file or environment variables set on your server).

The authOptions object satisfies the NextAuthOptions interface, ensuring that it adheres to the required structure for configuring NextAuth.

The comment satisfies NextAuthOptions indicates that the authOptions object conforms to the structure defined by the NextAuthOptions interface. It's a form of documentation or annotation for developers.

In summary, the provided code sets up authentication options for NextAuth, specifically configuring Google authentication using OAuth2 with the provided client ID and client secret obtained from environment variables. */
