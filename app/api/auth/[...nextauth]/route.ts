/* Importing authOptions: The code imports the authOptions object from the @/auth module. This likely contains configuration options and settings for the authentication process, such as authentication providers, callbacks, and other settings specific to NextAuth.

Importing NextAuth: The code imports the NextAuth module from the next-auth package. NextAuth is a function provided by the NextAuth library that initializes the authentication process based on the provided configuration.

Initializing NextAuth: The NextAuth function is called with the authOptions object as its argument. This initializes NextAuth with the provided configuration options, setting up the authentication flow according to the specified settings.

Exporting handler as GET and POST: The handler function, which represents the initialized NextAuth instance, is exported twice, once as GET and once as POST. This means that the same handler function is used to handle both HTTP GET and POST requests to the /api/auth/[...nextauth]/ route. It ensures consistency in handling authentication requests regardless of the HTTP method used.

In summary, this code sets up the authentication endpoint (/api/auth/[...nextauth]/) in a Next.js API route by initializing NextAuth with the provided configuration options (authOptions). It then exports the initialized NextAuth handler function to handle both GET and POST requests to the authentication endpoint. */
