# Complete SaaS with NEXT.JS 13

This repository contains the codebase for building a complete Software as a Service (SaaS) platform using NEXT.JS 13 with various integrations and features including Stripe Payments, Shadcn, Firebase, TypeScript (TS), and NextAuth. The guide for building this SaaS platform was created by Sonny Sangha.

## Features

- **Stripe Payments Integration**: Implement Stripe Checkout sessions to subscribe users to payments.
- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage Firebase v9 including the Firestore Database & Firebase Authentication.
- **Firebase Extensions**: Utilize Firebase Extensions such as "Run Payments with Stripe" and "Translate Text in Firestore" to seamlessly connect Firebase with Stripe and translate user messages in real-time.
- **Stripe Webhooks**: Dynamically update the Firestore database when Stripe events occur using Stripe Webhooks.
- **Beautiful UI & UX**: Create a beautiful UI and UX for the SaaS platform using the highly popular Shadcn and Tailwind CSS.
- **Form Validation**: Correctly validate forms with Zod to ensure type safety.
- **Global State Management**: Leverage Zustand for global state management.
- **Authentication**: Implement login and logout authentication flow using NextAuth on Next.js 13.
- **Middleware & Security**: Protect page routes and API routes using NextAuth middleware and implement Firebase Rules to secure the Firestore Database.
- **Skeleton Loaders**: Use skeleton loaders while data is being fetched to enhance user experience.
- **Custom Hooks**: Create custom hooks to simplify code and enhance reusability.
- **Dark Mode**: Implement dark mode toggling to update the UI based on user preference.
- **TypeScript**: Utilize TypeScript to reduce the overall number of bugs and errors.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the final build on Vercel.
